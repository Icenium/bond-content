	> Each tutorial should have **only one metadata file** named `metadata.json`. The metadata files in this folder are examples for the structure of the project object depending on the service type.

- `lesson` files - the tutorial content is split on multiple parts (lessons) that should be executed successively. This folder contains 3 sample lessons - `1-lesson-one.md`, `2-lesson-two.md` and `3-lesson-three.md`. 

	>The only requirement for the **file names** is that their **alphabetical order** should be **the same as** the **logical order** of the lessons.

	Each lesson contains the following information:
	-  `title` (*format:## Lesson &lt;Number&gt;. &lt;Title&gt;*) - the title of the lesson e.g. *## Lesson 1. Build a photo album*.
	-  `introduction` (*string*, *optional*) - information about the goal of the current lesson.
	-  `steps` - each lesson is split on multiple parts (steps) that should be executed  successively. Each step contains the following information:
		- `title` (*format:### Step &lt;Number&gt;. &lt;Title&gt;*) - the title of the step
		- `introduction` (*string*, *optional*) - information about the goal of the current step.
		- `actions` - each step is split on multiple parts (actions) that should be executed  successively.
		- `summary`  (*string*, *optional*) - more information about the achieved goals and a conclusion
	- `summary` (*string*, *optional*) - more information about the achieved goals and a conclusion. 

- `images` folder - containing the image files used in the tutorial.
